# Exchange


GMX is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange that offers spot and perpetual futures trading with low swap fees and zero price impact trades. Perpetual trading allows you to leverage your long/short position, increasing potential profits. Be careful, however, as it also increases risks. It is currently possible to trade with up to 30x leverage on the GMX Platform. Trading is supported by a unique multi-asset pool that earns liquidity providers fees from market making, swap fees, and leverage trading. Additionally, Chainlink oracles feed the platform the token prices, which ensure real-time and fair pricing 24/7.

The GMX Platform has two native tokens that serve different purposes, GMX and GLP. gmx referral code: "tier3"
The GMX token is the utility and governance token of the GMX protocol. Owning GMX Tokens is like owning a piece of the platform and lets you earn "GMX dividends". 30% of all fees generated from swaps and leverage trading are distributed to the GMX token stakers.

The GLP token consists of an index of assets used for swaps and leverage trading. It can be minted using any index asset and burnt to redeem any index asset. This is GMX's way of providing liquidity for leveraged trades. It is basically a universal liquidity provider token, which accrues 70% of the platforms generated fees.
